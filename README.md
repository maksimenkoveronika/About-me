As a Quality Assurance Engineer with 2+ years of experience, I specialize in Manual and Functional Testing for web and mobile applications, focusing on E-Commerce (Magento, Shopify), Fintech, and Cryptocurrency sectors. I've successfully delivered high-quality software across 10+ projects, ensuring reliability and performance.

I have hands-on experience leading a QA team in a volunteer project, creating comprehensive test documentation from scratch, and implementing new testing tools that improved efficiency. My passion for quality extends to mentoring 44 students in QA courses, guiding them through testing techniques, and offering practical feedback.

At my current role, I've quickly adapted to a diverse range of applications, such as YouTube, TikTok, Amazon, Google, and more. 

Key achievements include:
- Conducted full regression testing for platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Etsy, reporting 30+ critical bugs and suggesting UX/UI improvements that were successfully implemented.
- Created complete test documentation and checklists for new features and apps (e.g., Amazon Affiliate, Google Reviews, TikTok) to standardize testing processes.
- Utilized MySQL and DBeaver to manage databases, perform queries, and optimize application settings.

My core competencies include Web and Mobile Testing, Functional and Non-Functional Testing, and strong documentation skills, with proficiency in tools like Postman, SQL, MySQL, DBeaver, Linux Commands, Git, Grafana, and many others.
